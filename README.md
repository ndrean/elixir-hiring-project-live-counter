## Additions - changes

`Libcluster` with "localEPDM" to cluster the nodes.

An SQLITE DB for persistence with a unique table COUNTER, with two records: `region`, `count`.

Every change of the GenServer state is saved in the database.

On mount, the socket state is populated by reading the DB and broadcasted to update users view.

On leave, the state is updated
